# ðŸª„ ft_printf
Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough

### Goals:
- Learn use of variadic functions in C.
- Write a library that contains ft_printf(), a function that will mimic the original printf().

### Function prototype
``` c
int    ft_printf(const char *, ...);
```
### Requirements
â€¢ Donâ€™t implement the buffer management of the original printf().
â€¢ The function has to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
â€¢ The function will be compared against the original printf().
â€¢ Must use the command ar to create the library.
â€¢ Using the libtool command is forbidden.
â€¢ libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of the repository.

### Implement the following conversions:
â€¢ %c Prints a single character.
â€¢ %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
â€¢ %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format. â€¢ %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
â€¢ %i Prints an integer in base 10.
â€¢ %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
â€¢ %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
â€¢ %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
â€¢ %% Prints a percent sign.
